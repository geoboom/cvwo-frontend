# Do It Together, a real-time todo app
(Built for CVWO Assignment. Just found out about CVWO so I only had a few days to work on it. Not very feature rich :(. )

- Made in react.
- Hosting and CI/CD via Netlify.
- Communicates with backend (on herokuapp) mostly via Ruby on Rails ActionCable, a websockets implementation. 
- Due to time constraints:
  - No local/async storage unfortunately.
  - No redux/mobx state management either.
  - Search feature is not working either.
